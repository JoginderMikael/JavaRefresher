	/*
	 * This class is for NOTES ONLY 
	 * Java Persistence API (JPA) is a specification for managing relational data in Java applications.
	 * It provides a standard way to map Java objects to database tables and vice versa,
	 * allowing developers to work with databases using object-oriented programming concepts.
	 * 
	 * ISSUES OF JDBC
	 * 1. Boilerplate Code: JDBC requires a lot of boilerplate code for tasks like establishing connections,
	 * preparing statements, and handling result sets, which can lead to verbose and error-prone code.
	 * 2. Manual Mapping: Developers need to manually map database tables to Java objects,
	 * which can be tedious and error-prone, especially for complex schemas.
	 * 3. Lack of Portability: JDBC code is often tightly coupled to a specific database,
	 * making it difficult to switch databases without significant code changes.
	 * 
	 * JPA utilizes ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to address these issues by automating the mapping process
	 * and providing a higher-level abstraction for database interactions.
	 * 
	 * TOOls to implement ORM in JPA
	 * 1. Hibernate: One of the most popular JPA implementations, Hibernate provides a robust ORM framework
	 * with advanced features like caching, lazy loading, and support for complex mappings.
	 * 2. EclipseLink: The reference implementation of JPA, EclipseLink offers a comprehensive set of features
	 * for ORM, including support for various database platforms and advanced query capabilities.	
	 * 3. OpenJPA: An Apache project that provides a JPA implementation with a focus on performance and scalability,	
	 * 4. DataNucleus: A JPA implementation that supports a wide range of datastores, including relational databases,
	 * NoSQL databases, and file-based storage.
	 * 5. iBATIS/MyBatis: While not a full JPA implementation, MyBatis is a persistence framework	
	 * that provides ORM-like capabilities and can be used alongside JPA for more complex scenarios.
	 * 6. TopLink: A commercial JPA implementation that offers advanced features for enterprise applications,	
	 * 
	 * These tools help developers leverage the benefits of JPA and ORM,
	 * making it easier to manage relational data in Java applications.
	 * 
	 * TO CREATE HIBERNATE PROJECT IN ECLIPSE
	 * 1. Create a new Java Project in Eclipse.
	 * 2. Right-click on the project and select "Properties."
	 * 3. Go to "Java Build Path" and click on the "Libraries" tab.
	 * 4. Click on "Add External JARs" and add the Hibernate core JAR files
	 *   along with any required dependencies (like JDBC driver, JPA API, etc.).
	 *   5. Create a new folder named "src/main/resources" in your project to store configuration files.
	 *   6. Create a Hibernate configuration file named "hibernate.cfg.xml"
	 *   in the "src/main/resources" folder.
	 *   7. Define your entity classes with JPA annotations.
	 *   8. Write your main application code to interact with the database using Hibernate.
	 *   	
	 *   Note: Alternatively, you can use build tools like Maven or Gradle to manage dependencies more easily.
	 *   *   This approach allows you to specify Hibernate and its dependencies in a configuration file,
	 *   *   and the build tool will handle downloading and including them in your project automatically.
