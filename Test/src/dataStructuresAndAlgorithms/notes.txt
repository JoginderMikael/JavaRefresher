Data structure -> a named location that can be used to store and organize data. 

example: array - A collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations. 
eg char[] array -> ['H','E','L','L','O']

Algorithm -> A collection of steps to solve a problem. 

Example: Baking a pizza
		1. Heat the oven
		2. kead the dough
		3. add topings, et
		
		
		eg in java.
		
		Linear search one by one, example elements of an array to find a value. 
		
Why Learn data structures and algorithms?

	1. To write a code that is both time and memory efficient. 
	2. commonely asked questions involve the use of data structures and algorithsms in coding interviews.
